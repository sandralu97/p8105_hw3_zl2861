## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Observations are the
level of items in orders by users. There are users / order variables:
user ID, order ID, order day, order day. Time variables include name,
aisle, department, and some numeric codes. The information of the item
is matched with an order placed by a specific user. Each item belongs to
an aisle (with an aisle ID), which is further categorized under a
department (with a department ID).

**How many aisles are there? Which are most items from?**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles and most items come from “fresh vegetable”, “fresh
fruit” and “packaged vegetables fruits” aisles.

This person is not as active on Saturday as other days in the week. His
activity is also more stable on Tuesday and Wednesday across the 5 weeks

**Activity over the course of the day**

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x=minute_of_day, y=activity_count,color = day))+geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
    labs(
    title = "Activity over the course of the day",

Everyday, the activity count is usually low at mid-night and morning
(0-500 min, 12 o’clock to 8 o’clock) and stable at around 300 count at
day (500-1250 min, 8 o’clock to 21 o’clock) then drop again. However,
there is a peak activity at 500-750 min (8 o’clock to 12 o’clock) on
Sunday and 1250 min (21 o’clock) on Friday.

## Problem 3

load data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains the information and statistics of weather
information in New York. The dimension of this dataset is 2595176\*7.
Each weather station has an uniq id (id) and data were entered by date.
Weather statistics include precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum
temperature and minimum temperature of the day. However, some weather
stations only record some of the information. For example, there are
1134420 missing observations for minumum temperature and 1134358 missing
from maximum temperature

clean data

``` r
noaa_df = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
    separate(date,into = c("year","month","day"),remove = TRUE,convert = TRUE) %>% 
mutate(

  tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
  prcp = prcp/10,
  tmax = tmax/10,
  tmin = tmin/10
)

The maximum temperature in January and July both fluctuated between
years with the similar pattern (triangle-like shape) around every 5
years. For example, they are both higher at the beginning of 1990s, then
dropped during early 1990s and higher again in mid 1990s. There is an
outlier of max temperature (particular lower than others) in January
between 1980 and 1985 as well as outliers (particular lower than others)
in July between 1985 and 1990, 2000 to 2005 and 2006 to 2010
