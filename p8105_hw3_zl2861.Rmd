## Problem 1

```{r}
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns.
Observations are the level of items in orders by users. There are users / order variables: user ID, order ID, order day, order day. Time variables include name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes. The information of the item is matched with an order placed by a specific user. Each item belongs to an aisle (with an aisle ID), which is further categorized under a department (with a department ID). 

**How many aisles are there? Which are most items from?**
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles and most items come from "fresh vegetable", "fresh fruit" and "packaged vegetables fruits" aisles.

**Plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle**
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n>10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle,n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=n))+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5,hjust=1))
```

**Table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”**

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits") ) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank=min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank<4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle,rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

**Table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week**

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name,order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day) ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```


##Problem 2

**load & clean data**
```{r}
accel_df=
  read_csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute_of_day",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    week=as.numeric(week),
    day_id=as.numeric(day_id),
    day=as.factor(day),
    minute_of_day = as.integer(minute_of_day),
    activity_count = as.numeric(activity_count)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(weekday=case_when(
    day %in% c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday") ~ "weekday",
    day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "weekend"
  )
    
  )

```

This dataset contains the activity count measure by Accelerometers of a 63 year-old male with BMI 25 according to week, day, minute of the day and whether it is weekend or not. There are `r nrow(accel_df)` observations, `r ncol(accel_df)` variables. 

**Total activity over the day**

```{r}
accel_df %>% 
    mutate(
    day = factor(day),
    day_num = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ 1,
      day == "Tuesday" ~ 2,
      day == "Wednesday" ~3,
      day == "Thursday" ~4,
      day == "Friday" ~5,
      day == "Saturday" ~6,
      day == "Sunday" ~7
    ),
    day = fct_reorder(day,day_num)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity = sum(activity_count))%>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_activity
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

This person is not as active on Saturday as other days in the week. His activity is also more stable on Tuesday and Wednesday across the 5 weeks

**Activity over the course of the day**

```{r}
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x=minute_of_day, y=activity_count,color = day))+geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
    labs(
    title = "Activity over the course of the day",
    x = "Minute of the Day",
    y = "Activity count"
  )
```

Everyday, the activity count is usually low at mid-night and morning (0-500 min, 12 o'clock to `r round(500/60,digit=0)` o'clock) and stable at around 300 count at day (500-1250 min, `r round(500/60,digit=0)` o'clock to `r round(1250/60,digit=0)` o'clock) then drop again.
However, there is a peak activity at 500-750 min (`r round(500/60,digit=0)` o'clock to `r round(750/60,digit=0)` o'clock)  on Sunday and 1250 min (`r round(1250/60,digit=0)` o'clock) on Friday.

## Problem 3

load data
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains the information and statistics of weather information in New York. The dimension of this dataset is `r nrow(ny_noaa)`*`r ncol(ny_noaa)`. Each weather station has an uniq id (id) and data were entered by date. Weather statistics include precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature and minimum temperature of the day. However, some weather stations only record some of the information. For example, there are `r sum(is.na(ny_noaa$tmin))` missing observations for minumum temperature and `r sum(is.na(ny_noaa$tmax))` missing from maximum temperature

clean data

```{r}
noaa_df = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
    separate(date,into = c("year","month","day"),remove = TRUE,convert = TRUE) %>% 
mutate(
  tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
  tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
  prcp = prcp/10,
  tmax = tmax/10,
  tmin = tmin/10
)
  
```

**Most common observed snowfall value**

```{r}
noaa_df %>% 
  drop_na(snow) %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank<4)
```

The most commonly observed snowfall value is 0, 13 and 25 mm


**Average max temperature in Januray and June**

```{r}
noaa_df %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) %>% 
  mutate(
    monthname = case_when(
      month == 1 ~ "January",
      month == 7 ~ "July"
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(id,year,monthname) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean_tmax,group = id,color = id))+geom_point()+geom_path()+ theme(legend.position = "none")+facet_grid(. ~ monthname)+
  labs(
    title = "Mean Maximum Temperature in New York",
    x = "Time (year)",
    y = "Mean Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the noaa package"
  )
